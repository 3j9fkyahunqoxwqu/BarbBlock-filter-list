## BarbBlock filter list

This list blocks requests to sites which have used legal threats to remove themselves from other blacklists.


## Project goal?
This list is designed to avoid installing just another addon called [BarbBlock](https://github.com/paulgb/BarbBlock) which not adds any layer to security. So I decided to publish it's list which you can use for existent solutions like uMatrix, uBlock, ....
